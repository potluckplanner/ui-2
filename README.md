##POTLUCK PLANNER

Potluck Planner is an application that guides users through the process of setting up a potluck. Users can create a potluck event, set a time and location and then invite guests and add a food/item checklist for guests to pick from. Guests have the ability to additionally indicate if they're bringing items not on the initial list.

##GETTING STARTED

As a web application, Potluck Planner only requires a browser capable of running HTML5 and CSS3 to work. Users are encouraged to have a theme in mind for their actual potluck as well, to accommodate food selection.

##INSTALLING

1. Go to https://potluckplanner.github.io/ui-2/index.html
2. Click on the "Register" button to create a new account
3. Plan a potluck!
